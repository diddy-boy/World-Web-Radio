This is an easy to use HTML web based streaming radio with a fixed list of stations as well as a dynamic list of stations from https://de1.api.radio-browser.info/json/stations/topclick/100 
This has a graphic equaliser and an audio compressor so all stations should be at the same volume. 
no more quiet web radio stations and then a really loud station on selection The list can grow as more web radio stations are added to de1.api.radio web site. 
All settings are stored locally so future use remembers equaliser bands, volume and current station selected
